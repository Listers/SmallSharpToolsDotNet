Notes

SmallSharpTools.Pipes will provide a set of repository pattern interfaces to access
Twitter, YouTube and Flickr content for the purposes of aggregating the content to
display on a web site or in an application.

The implementions will be in separate class libraries and injected with IoC.

The IoC implementation will be Unity from the Enterprise Library.
